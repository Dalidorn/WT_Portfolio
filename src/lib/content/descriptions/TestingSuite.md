### Goal:
Develop a comprehensive suite of tests to ensure the quality, security, performance, and accessibility of all current projects, leveraging industry-leading tools and methodologies.

### Overview:
This project aims to provide a robust and thorough testing framework for each element of all my projects. Utilizing a range of specialized tools such as Cypress for end-to-end testing, Postman for API testing, OWASP ZAP for security testing, Lighthouse for accessibility and performance auditing, JMeter for load testing, and Jest for unit testing, the suite ensures comprehensive coverage and high-quality standards. This is far more advanced than needed for the small scale software I develop for the purpose of practicing and learning.
