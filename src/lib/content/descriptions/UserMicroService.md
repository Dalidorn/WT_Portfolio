### Goal:
Develop a robust micro-service to handle all user-related services for any of my applications, ensuring synchronization, security, and comprehensive authentication methods in a single centralized location.

### Overview:
This project aims to create a reliable and secure User Micro Service that manages all user-related functionalities across different applications. Built with MongoDB and Node.js, the micro-service is responsible for synchronization and maintenance between the other databases requiring user information. Given the sensitive nature of the data, it employs the highest security standards to protect personal information. The service includes OAuth and SSO capabilities to streamline authentication processes and provide a smooth user experience.
